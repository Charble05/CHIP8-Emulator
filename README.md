# CHIP8-Emulator

There are two drop downs; Settings and ROMs

At first there will be no ROMs in the ROMs dropdown so you need to add one

You can open .ch8 files with the Load New ROM option under the settings dropdown

You can also change the pixel on and off colors from the same drop down. A color picker dialog will open.
